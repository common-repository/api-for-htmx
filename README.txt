An unofficial WordPress plugin that enables the use of HTMX on your WordPress site, theme, and/or plugins. Intended for software developers.

== Description ==
An unofficial WordPress plugin that enables the use of HTMX on WordPress. Adds a new endpoint `/wp-htmx/v1/` from which you can load any HTMX template.

HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows you to access AJAX, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes, without writing any JavaScript. It reuses an "old" concept, [Hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/), to handle the modern web in a more HTML-like and natural way.

Check the [full feature set at here](https://github.com/TCattd/HTMX-API-WP).

This plugin will include the HTMX library by default, locally from the plugin folder. If you enable Alpine.js and/or Hyperscript, they will also be included locally.

The plugin has an opt-in option, not enforced, to include these third-party libraries from a CDN (using the unpkg.com service). You must explicitly enable this option for privacy and security reasons.

1. Install API-for-HTMX from WordPress repository. Plugins > Add New > Search for: API-for-HTMX. Activate it.
